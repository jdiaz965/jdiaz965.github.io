<p>I'm 17 years old and my birthday is on September 9,2000. I play for the Varsity baseball team here at Lawndale High School and I am the captain of the team. I have one sister that is 12 years old and she goes to Jane Adaams Middle School. My positions for baseball are Shortstop, Catcher, and Pitcher. I've played baseball since I was 2 years young and my dream when I was younger was to be a MLB player.I love my family and I'm going to everything I can so I can make them proud. Go to college and hope to pursue my childhood dream.</p>
